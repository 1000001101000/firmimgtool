# firmimgtool

Fork of the original tool used to build/extract firmware images for the first generation of Buffalo NAS devices (PowerPC and MIPS based Linkstation/Terastation/Kurobox).

So far I have:
- Created a simple Makefile that supports cross compile.
- Tested it on armel and PowerPC (32-bit). The original code fails on 64-bit architectures (working on it).
